# Model Predictive Control Project
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The goal of this project is to implement an Model Predictive Control in C++ to drive a vehicle around the track in a [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). Escentially, the MPC manipulates the steering wheel and throttle to minimize the cross track error (CTE) and orientation error, while maintaining constant vehicle speed, in presense of 100 millisecond actuation latency.
